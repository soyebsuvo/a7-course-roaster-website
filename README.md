# Course Registration


## Project Features
- You can easily purchase the courses from this website.
- You can purchase courses according to your credit limit. Once the credit limit is over, no more courses can be purchased.
- You can only purchase a course once. It will also show you the total cost of the courses you purchase

## Discussion About state management
- On clicking the select button of each course, I have stored the data of each course in a state through event handler and props.

- From inside the event handler function, I have stored all the necessary information in the new states. Eg: Credits, Price, Course Name, Remaining Credits.

- Again, I took my stored data and used it wherever needed through props. Basically this is how I managed the states.
